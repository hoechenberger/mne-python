# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the MNE-Python Dev Container!

It's so great to see you! ðŸ¤©

This appears to be the first time you're starting up the container,
or you've restarted it after uninstalling MNE-Python.

In any case, **we're currently running the MNE-Python installation
procedure.** You can view progress by opening the terminal window
with the the spinning icon (or exclamation mark, in some cases!) in the bottom-right of
your screen!

Once installation is finished, that terminal window will close and your browser will
open to connect you to a VNC desktop. This is where interactive plots will appear.

Enjoy, have a great day, and: **Happy hacking!** ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
